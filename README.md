# Google-StreetView-Download-to-shapefile
The 'GSV_fetch.py' fetches Google street view images for each location of an input point shapefile. This program also creates a new point shapefile with the local drive links to the downloaded street view images added to the attribute table. Image metadata will be downloaded too as a separate file.
